## etch-a-sketch

A digital representation of the classic toy, created as part of the curriculum for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

Users can choose from multiple painting styles:

* A default grey
* Shading mode - each pass over a square adds 10% more black, looping back again to a lighter shade and beginning again
* Rainbow mode - every pass over a square generates a completely random colour
* Erase, setting the selected square back to plain white

Users can also reset the grid at any time, and declare the number of grid-squares they would like to play with, up to a maximum of 100 x 100.

The primary goals of this project were to get a better understanding of EventListeners, DOM manipulation, along with a refresher on CSS positioning.
